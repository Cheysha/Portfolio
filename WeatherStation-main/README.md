# WeatherStation

Project targeting embedded microcontrollers such as the Espressif ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi Pico. Utilizing the Arduino framework (C++), the project demonstrates capabilities of these devices. The Example Project is a weather station that leverages the power of an ESP32 microcontroller to connect to a WLAN and present real-time weather data obtained through HTTP on an external serial monitor.
