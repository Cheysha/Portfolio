# Cheys's Github Portfolio!
Hello and welcome to my Github portfolio! Here, you will find a showcase of some of the projects that I have worked on.

## Projects
### WeatherStation
A Project targeting embedded microcontrollers such as the Espressif ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi Pico. Utilizing the Arduino framework, the project demonstrates capabilities of these devices. The Example Project is a weather station that leverages the power of an ESP32 microcontroller to connect to a WLAN and present real-time weather data obtained through HTTP on an external serial monitor.

### PokeGame2 
Version 2 of the Pokegame, which I developed during my Computer Science I course, incorporates exciting new features. Utilizing pandas dataframes, it can generate Pokemon from a database. In addition, I aim to add a multiplayer mode that runs over TCP, powered by the Python sockets module.
